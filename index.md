As the world faces increasingly urgent environmental challenges, the need for sustainable technologies and practices becomes paramount. The International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing (ICSOC) has long been at the forefront of advancing service-oriented architecture (SOA) and related technologies. In alignment with the conference's objectives, we propose a workshop on "Sustainable Service-Oriented Computing: Addressing Environmental, Social, and Economic Dimensions" to explore the intersection of service-oriented computing and sustainability. 

This workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers, practitioners, and industry experts to discuss and explore the integration of sustainability principles within service-oriented computing. It acknowledges that service-oriented systems have significant environmental, social, and economic implications, and seeks to promote research and collaboration that can address these dimensions.

excerpt: "1st International Workshop on Sustainable Service-Oriented Computing: Addressing Environmental, Social, and Economic Dimensions co-located with ICSOC 2023"
---

As the world faces increasingly urgent environmental challenges, the need for sustainable technologies and practices becomes paramount. The International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing (ICSOC) has long been at the forefront of advancing service-oriented architecture (SOA) and related technologies. In alignment with the conference's objectives, we propose a workshop on "Sustainable Service-Oriented Computing: Addressing Environmental, Social, and Economic Dimensions" to explore the intersection of service-oriented computing and sustainability. 

This workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers, practitioners, and industry experts to discuss and explore the integration of sustainability principles within service-oriented computing. It acknowledges that service-oriented systems have significant environmental, social, and economic implications, and seeks to promote research and collaboration that can address these dimensions. 


## Call for paper

Topics of interest for the workshop include, but are not limited to:
- Green service-oriented architectures and sustainable software design
- Energy-efficient service composition and deployment strategies
- Optimization techniques for reducing the carbon footprint of service-based systems
- Sustainable service discovery and selection mechanisms
- Sustainable service management and monitoring approaches
- Sustainable cloud computing and data center management
- Service-based solutions for sustainability challenges in specific domains (e.g., smart cities, healthcare, transportation)
- Evaluating the environmental and social impact of service-oriented systems
- Business models and economic incentives for sustainable service-oriented computing
- Social implications of service-oriented computing, including equity and accessibility considerations
- Machine learning approaches for the sustainability of service-oriented architectures
- Sustainability-driven refactoring of service-oriented architectures
- Sustainability requirements for service-oriented architectures
- Open challenges on sustainable service-oriented architecture
- Evaluation of the impact of sustainability on other quality aspects

Participants will have the opportunity to present their research, exchange ideas, and discuss practical experiences in integrating sustainability principles into service-oriented computing.
The workshop will feature keynote talks from experts in the field, paper presentations, panel discussions, and interactive sessions to foster collaboration and identify future research directions.
We invite researchers, practitioners, and industry representatives to submit original papers, case studies, and position papers for consideration.

Accepted contributions will be published in the workshop proceedings. By exploring the synergy between sustainability and service-oriented computing, this workshop seeks to drive innovations that can mitigate the environmental impact, enhance social equity, and promote economic sustainability in the development and deployment of service-oriented systems. Together, let us pave the way for a more sustainable future through service-oriented computing.

## Submission

SSCOPE 2023 seeks contributions in the form of:
- 12 pages for full research papers in LNCS format, including references;
- 8 pages for short vision and emerging results papers in LNCS format, including references.

All submitted papers will be reviewed on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity by the program committee.
